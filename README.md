## 1. Introduction

The Mars Terrain Simulator aims to address several critical challenges associated with Mars avatars, especially the challenges of navigation of the Martian surface. 
The simulator uses real mars terrain data collected by MRO(Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) to provide accurate and detailed avatar simulation. 
Additionally, it features a modular brain system, allowing users to replace and test different pathfinding algorithms within the avatar. 
This flexibility enables comparative evaluation of various navigation strategies under realistic Martian conditions, enhancing research and development in autonomous planetary exploration. 
The simulator provides user-friendly interfaces and supports visualization of the simulation, allowing the users to learn and use the simulator with ease. 

The simulator may serve as a basic and valuable test for pathfinding algorithms in development or be used as a convenient teaching tool for algorithm design and evaluation. 
By providing an interactive and realistic simulation environment, the simulator allows students and researchers to explore various pathfinding, optimization, and decision-making algorithms in a controlled Martian terrain.
