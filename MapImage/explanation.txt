This folder contains map data of the Martian terrain - Louth Crater ice mound
The following is a description of each file
LouthCraterFullColorGraph.png - Layered color topographic map of the full crater
Depth is the depth value relative to a reference height surface (such as an average height on the surface of Mars).
In this case, higher values ​​(negative numbers closer to zero) indicate higher terrain, while lower values ​​(more negative numbers) indicate lower or deeper terrain.
For example, -4560 may indicate a ridge, while -4700 may indicate a crater

1000x1000subgraph.png - is a layered color topographic map of a 1000*1000 cut-out crater partial map

1000x1000Louth_Crater_ice_mound_subPart.tif - is a tif file saved as a cut-out 1000*1000 crater partial map

1000x1000test.jpg - is the actual image of the partial map on a real satellite image

LouthCraterRealimage.jpg - a real satellite image of the Louth Crater ice mound

MarkLouthCraterRealimage.jpg is a marked file, marked with a red square box, the part to be cut out in the full terrain (

Process of cutting tif images

1. Clear the path of the image

2. Clear the path of the tif file

2. Use the following function to present the jpg file in matplotlib and get the coordinates of two points in the jpg image in the figure. These two points form the two endpoints of the right diagonal of the square to be cut
tifreader.display_image_with_matplotlib(image_path, title="x x x x")
The origin of the coordinate axis is in the upper left corner

3. Use the map_jpg_to_tif_coordinates function to convert the selected jpg coordinates into tif coordinates
coordinates = tifreader.map_jpg_to_tif_coordinates(image_path, file_path, x, y)

4. Use the tifreader.calculate_square_Length(file_path, roi) function to calculate the actual side length of the square surrounded by the two points

5. Use tifreader.crop_and_resize_tif(file_path, roi, outputsize) function to formally intercept the square. If the target intercepted side length (outputsize) is greater than or equal to the actual side length of the square surrounded by two points, directly return the square composed of the actual side length.

6. Specify the output file path

7. Use save_array_to_tif to save the intercepted square 2D array to the output file in the form of a tif file

optional: You can use the visualize_mars_terrain function to visualize the map in the form of a layered color topographic map hypsometric map
, where the second parameter range (tuple) type of visualize_mars_terrain is returned by find_min_max_in_polygon
